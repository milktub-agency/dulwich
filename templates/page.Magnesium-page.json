This influx of sodium releases calcium from the mitochondrion and this gives rise to a substance called AMP, which causes the cell membranes to become even more permeable. This vicious circle eventually results in cell death.<\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>[*What deprives the body of magnesium?<\/strong><br\/>A number of diseases increase magnesium loss inc. diabetes, kidney diseases and certain hormonal disorder. Magnesium loss with the urine is also increased by alcohol and various diuretic medicines, heart medicine and antibiotics.

The same applies regarding the increased amount of radiation and additives introduced to our food to make it last longer.<\/p>",
