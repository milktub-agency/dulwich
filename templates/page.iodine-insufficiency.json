For years, more than half the European population has had an insufficientdaily intake (2). Yet European native wild harvested seaweeds are rich food sources of well documented, bioavailable iodine (3), and iodine is one of the least available minerals in our agricultural soils (4).<\/strong><\/p><p><\/p><p>For 25 years Seagreens® has been providing independently certified nutrition supplements for iodine deficiency, and pure seaweed ingredients to manufacturing customers in many countries.<\/p><p><\/p><p>Leading UK brands like Cytoplan, G&G, Pukka, Napiers, and Viridian Nutrition; and Tisso Naturproduckte in Germany, Natural Point in Italy, and Bioteekki in Finland also produce good quality supplements containing<\/p><p>Seagreens® BDA certified nutritious food, seaweed.<\/p><p><\/p><p>Seagreens® range of products and ingredients provide a complete natural source of dietary micro nutrients and minerals including iodine.<\/p><p><\/p><h2><strong>[* What does iodine do? *]<\/strong><\/h2><p><\/p><p>Iodine is critical, in many bodily functions, particularly in the production of thyroid hormones. Insufficiency is a common cause of hypothyroidism (underactive, thyroid) (5) iodine is converted by the foot thyroid into thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which are essential to control, metabolic processes, such as breathing, heart rate, and menstrual cycles.<\/p><p><\/p><p>They influence body, weight and temperature, cholesterol levels, memory, glands, function, and the central, and peripheral nervous system (5). Symptoms of iodine deficiency include weight gain, muscle pain, lethargy, heart disease, cognitive impairment, and various cancers (6).<\/p><p> <\/p><h2><strong>[* The size of the problem *]<\/strong><\/h2><p><\/p><p>In the UK, 66% of women and over 75% of 14-year-old school girls tested (7), 82% of pregnant women (8), and 52% of 25-year-old students (3), were found to have insufficient dietary iodine. 49% of babies were found to be mildly deficient (9).<\/p><p><\/p><p>Sufficient daily intake is especially important in  women of child bearing age, in pregnancy, and in young children, since iodine is crucial for foetal and child  braindevelopment (10).<\/p><p><\/p><p>The link with iodine insufficiency was confirmed in women of child-bearing age in large-scale Scottish and Norwegian studies as recently as 2017 (11, 12).<\/p><p><\/p><p>Even a mild form of iodine deficiency during pregnancy has an irreversible impact on the child’s educational  outcomes during the first 9 years of life. Autism in  children may be 4 times more likely if the mother has a weakened thyroid function during pregnancy (13).<\/p><p><\/p><p><em>[* Food based iodine is recommended.

It restored iodine sufficiency in deficient female subjects given a daily intake of 2x 500mg vegetable capsules, and normalised TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) with no adverse effect on thyroid function.<\/p><p><\/p><p>In addition, the Seagreens® seaweed was found  to provide more prolonged and stable uptake than manufactured potassium iodide (see opposite), which for decades has been used to fortify industrial and domestic table salt. The research was published in 2014 in the British Journal of Nutrition (3). Nevertheless, governments continue to specify cheaper potassium iodide, most recently to fortify bread and other baked goods in Denmark (14). Formulated iodine supplements may also contain high levels of potassium iodide.<\/p><p><\/p><p>The researchers concluded that Seagreens® iodine is <em>“modestly bioavailable at 33%”<\/em>, and improved iodine intake by 60%. Prolonged daily use does not interfere with the drug thyroxin commonly prescribed for underactive thyroid (hypothyroid), and would not exceed the recommended maximum daily intake even if consumed by those with sufficient iodine (3).<\/p><p><\/p>",

Iodine receptors reject excessive iodine, freely excreted in urine. Naturally occurring halogens such as chlorine and bromine, ubiquitous as additional industrial pollutants, may reduce the bioavailability of total dietary iodine, because they compete for iodine receptors. A 2018 review in the international scientific journal Food Chemistry noted that “concerns over iodine toxicity from eating seaweed appear to be unfounded. However, seaweed must be sourced from near-pristine and clean environments, where there is no concern for biological and chemical contamination or other  environmental pollutants” (18). All the recent data supports this view. “Despite high levels of iodine present in some seaweeds, ingestion of large amounts will not necessarily imply a risk for excessive intake of iodine. In the most recent research, only 49-82% of seaweed iodine appeared to have bioavailability (to systemic circulation) after gastrointestinal digestion, and it was suggested that seaweed iodine may have low bioavailability ( &lt;30% )” (19). <\/p><p><\/p><p><em>[* Seagreens® seaweed is produced to Nutritious Food Seaweed standard, complies with international food safety and organic regulations, and research shows is at least 33% bioavailable (3).
