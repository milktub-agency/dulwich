Exercise reduces stress, anxiety and depression by releasing the ‘feel good’ hormones from your brain.</p><p></p><p>Ideally you should walk 10,000 steps per day = 3.5 miles. A brisk walk of 30 to 40 minutes, 3 to 4 times a week is even better.</p><p></p><p>Using a <a href=\"https://www.dulwichhealth.co.uk/product/pt-rebounder-uk-only/?v=13b5bfe96f3e\"><strong>Rebounder</strong></a> at home is not only the most efficient and effective form of exercise, it is fun and only takes a few minutes a day.</p><p></p><p>A<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://dulwichhealth.co.uk/?p=1712\"><strong>Rebounder</strong></a> helps circulation. Increases mobility. Aids weight loss. Relieves pain. Reduces stress and tension. Stimulates metabolism. Boosts the lymphatic immune system. Improves eye-sight. Helps build new energy. Revitalises your life.</p><p></p><p>The most efficient means of exercise is on a <a href=\"https://dulwichhealth.co.uk/?p=1712\"><strong>Rebounder</strong></a><strong>,</strong> which is smaller and stiffer than a trampoline. You can rebound even if you are confined to a wheelchair. It is also very good if you have had injuries, or suffer from arthritis, rheumatism, asthma, ME, diabetes, Multiple Sclerosis, cystic fibrosis, Parkinson’s disease, heart complaints and depression. By rebounding you increase gravity by 25% both on the down and the up movement, revitalising your thymus (so you produce more T-cells to protect your body), lymph system (which has no pump) and help to dispose of toxins from your body.</p><p></p><p>Six minutes on a <a href=\"https://www.dulwichhealth.co.uk/product/pt-rebounder-uk-only/?v=13b5bfe96f3e\"><strong>Rebounder</strong></a> is equivalent to walking 3 miles. 10 minutes is equal to jogging for 30 minutes and you do not have to change into running gear, put up with bad weather and a 40% chance of damaging your knees.</p><p></p><p>Many fit people over 90 rebound 10 minutes every day.</p><p></p><p>You can lose 300 calories in 6 minutes. It is the exercise you are most likely to keep up as it is fun and you can enjoy the exercises to music or watching TV.</p>",
