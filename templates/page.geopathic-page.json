When waking in the morning often feeling fatigued, with a muzzy head and backache. Children are often bed wetting and babies continuously crying.<\/p><p><\/p><p>GS does not cause an illness, but lowers your immune system, so you have less chance of fighting any illness.

The vibration distorted becomes abnormally high and harmful to living organisms.<\/p><p><\/p><p>Geopathic Stress has become many times stronger over the years. We believe this is due to ‘solar weather’ caused by the sun penetrating the weaker ozone layer more easily. No doubt the stronger GS is one of the main reasons for the steady increase in serious illness (cancer cases have doubled over the last 20 years).<\/p>",

However, there are now many recognised methods of detecting GS in people, like the VEGA Test, Blood Crystalline Analysis, electro-acupuncture, kinesiology etc. which can also confirm if the GS has been cleared.<\/p><p><\/p><h2>[* <strong>How do I know if I’m Geopathic stressed?<\/strong>*]<\/h2><h2><\/h2><p>If you cannot shake off an illness, depression or feel below par, ask yourself:<\/p><ol><li>Did my health problem begin shortly after moving into this home or place of work?<\/li><li>Do I feel better when I am away from the home or place of work?<\/li><li>Do any of my family feel uneasy about the ‘atmosphere’ at home?<\/li><li>Did the previous occupant’s suffer from any serious or long term illness?<\/li><li>Does the illness seem to be worse during autumn or spring or wet stormy weather? (when underground water may be flowing at higher velocity)<\/li><li>Were there any nearby disturbances, which may have caused underground water veins to flow into different channels under my house prior to my illness? (landslides, building and road work, working quarries and working mines etc)<\/li><li>Does my home or any part of it feel unnaturally cold or damp?<\/li><\/ol>",
            "content_3": "<p><\/p><p><strong>[*Geopathic Stress and Sleep*]<br\/><\/strong>Sleeping in a GS place is particularly stressful, as a large area of your body is exposed to the GS. Also most people sleep during the night, when the GS is stronger. During sleep your brain is supposed to rest half the time and is busy healing your body the other half. However, if you are GS during sleep your brain has to spend all of it’s time working due to the strain of GS and you wake up tired.<\/p><p><\/p><p>The 1 sq. metre (10 sq. ft.) you sleep on and therefore spend about one third of your life on, must be free from Geopathic Stress.<\/p><p><\/p><p>During sleep your brain does your body’s ‘housekeeping’ including creating 80% of your new cells, giving the right signals for your body to operate properly and absorb the correct level of vitamins and minerals together with adjusting hormone balance. GS will interfere with this process and leave your immune system weak. All these body functions will usually become normal very quickly after GS has cleared from your system, by sleeping in a GS-free place.<\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>[*M.E. Sufferers*]<br\/><\/strong>In a report published by the Royal Society of Medicine it was suggested most cases of chronic fatigue ‘would get well through sleep’. BUT people who are suffering from M.E. are most likely to be sleeping in a strong Geopathic Stressed place, thereby creating a vicious circle. You feel tired so you go to the worst place – your bed.<\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>[*Psychological Conditions*]<br\/><\/strong>GS is present in the majority of people who are depressed, suicidal and the many of people who get divorced (one or both spouses).<\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>[*Answers to Sceptics*]<br\/><\/strong>Many feel the effect of GS is purely psychological and due to suggestion, but then you cannot influence the behavior of animals, plants and babies.<\/p><p><\/p><p>Most animals will prefer to sleep in a good place and will become ill if forced to live in a GS home, stables etc.<\/p><p><\/p><p>Most types of trees will have stunted growth and not bear fruit in GS places. You will often find plants will not thrive in a GS place in a house.<\/p><p><\/p><p>Below are cases where babies have been trying to avoid GS in their sleep. All the babies slept peacefully after their cots were moved to a Geopathic Stress free place.<\/p>",

The outcome has often been that you have moved home again at great expense. That is why houses and flats badly affected by Geopathic Stress come on the market more often than homes, which have none or very little Geopathic Stress.<\/p><p><\/p><p>Have you ever wondered why you felt uneasy when you walked into a particular room or why most people in certain houses are all ill? Most likely it is due to Geopathic Stress.<\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>[*Long Life<br\/><\/strong>It is estimated your chances of living beyond mid-seventy is 90% unless you are Geopathic Stressed (not taking into account accidents, smoking, heavy users of drugs, bad diet and lack of Q10).<\/p><p><\/p><p>Remember Geopathic Stress does not cause any illness, but lowers your immune system and your ability to fight off viruses and bacterium.<\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>[*Feng Shui<br\/><\/strong>Most people who deal with Feng Shui realise GS is the first thing to check for to ensure a ‘happy home’.<\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>[*Your Health is like a bucket<br\/><\/strong>A bucket which gradually gets filled up with things harmful to your life. Geopathic Stress could fill up 50%. It then gets filled up by bad diet, unhealthy food additives, physical and mental strain from accidents, psychological trauma, smoking, excess drinking, strained relationships with other people, effects from illness, or death in the family, work, financial pressure, effects from electromagnetic fields and other environmental pollution etc.<\/p><p><\/p><p>Suddenly your bucket overflows and you get a serious illness.<\/p><p><\/p><p>Take the Geopathic Stress away, and your bucket may only be 50% full and your immune system will strengthen, enabling you to cope with e.g. E.Coli, power lines and all the other things listed above.<\/p><p><\/p><p>Many people seem to think we are getting more and more affected by Geopathic Stress. This is true, but mainly because we are filling up the bucket quicker by adding Pollution, etc.<\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>[*Pregnancy<br\/><\/strong>First of all GS will reduce your ability to create new life. It is estimated that over 90% of women who cannot conceive, they or their partners are sleeping in a GS place and in over 50% of cases it is the main cause of being infertile (except in cases of STDs). Natalie had tried to conceive for 15 years. She moved her bed and favourite chair out of GS places and is now pregnant. If you are then sleeping in a GS place during pregnancy it can be a major contributory factor in miscarriage or an unhealthy new-born baby.<\/p><p><\/p><p>The approximately 25,000 eggs a baby girl is born with, will be affected by Geopathic Stress, if you as a mother are GS during pregnancy. So GS may affect your grandchildren!<\/p><p><\/p><p>In all cases of cancer in children, I found that the mother was sleeping in a Geopathic Stress place during pregnancy. This has been confirmed indirectly by doctors as ‘the first hit’.<\/p><p><\/p><p>Also in Down’s Syndrome cases, I have found that the mother of the person slept in a Geopathic Stress place during pregnancy.<\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>[*Autism<\/strong><br\/>I have also found that, in all the cases where I have checked the mother of the person with autism, she was sleeping in a Geopathically Stressed place during her pregnancy.<\/p><p><\/p><p>In all cases when children are diagnosed with Autism, I have found that they were Geopathically Stressed. When children are no longer autistic, I find they are no longer Geopathically Stressed.<\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>[*Babies<br\/><\/strong>Babies will sleep very badly in GS places. Many confirm, including University Medical research Teams. that over 90% of babies, who died of Cot Death, had been sleeping in GS places.<\/p><p><\/p><p>Baby Mary was waking up sweating, crying and laying up against the edge of the cot at about 3am (A) each night.<\/p><p><\/p><p>After turning her bed round she slept in the middle of the cot and woke up relaxed and smiling at 7am (B)<\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>[*Children<br\/><\/strong>Children do not thrive in GS, and are often hyperactive and prone to allergies, asthma and eczema.<\/p><p><\/p><p>Kathe Bachler, the famous researcher, surveyed over 3000 school children and showed 95% of children with learning difficulties, hyperactive tendencies or continuous bad behavior, either slept or had their school desks (or both) in strong GS places. When she moved the children into stress free places, they nearly all showed a marked improvement often going from bottom to top of their class in one term.<\/p>"

This creates an electromagnetic field, which disturbs the earth’s natural vibrations in particular, the beneficially 7.83 Hz (cycle per second) Alpha vibrations (confirmed by NASA). The Alpha vibrations can be as high as 226 Hz in very Geopathic Stressed people. The USA scientist George Lakowsky confirmed in the ’30’s that humans (and animals) have less chance of fighting bacteria and viruses at higher than normal vibrations.<\/p><p><\/p><p>The effect GS has on the human body has most convincingly proved by a major research project undertaken by the university of Vienna direct by Professor Dr Otto Berman.<\/p><p><\/p><p>In order to eliminate any placebo effect the tests were organized in a double-blind fashion. Neither examining doctors not the people tested knew weather they had been sitting in a GS place or neutral place. 985 people were tested and subjected to a very thorough medical examination before and after testing. Tests included blood sedimentation, electric condulance of certain muscle points, blood pressure, heart rate, respiration, skin resistance and blood circulation. The people tested only sat in a GS or neutral place for 15 minutes. The harmful effect could be registered in most of the people who sat in a GS place. ‘One can imagine the consequences which exposure to Geopathic Stress over many years could have’.<\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>[*Keep Checking<br\/><\/strong>U.K. has over 800 earthquakes and 20,000 landslides each year which can effect GS.

Do not check for GS if you are ill.<\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>[*Royalty and Gypsies<br\/><\/strong>It is claimed that Queen Victoria sent dowsers to Scotland to find the ‘good energy’ area and they came up with where Balmoral now stands.
